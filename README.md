SkyblockExtension
=================

SkyblockExtension (SBE) is a modernized version of my very old skyblock plugin, created for the [Dwarfscraft Minecraft server](http://dwarfscraft.com)'s Skyblock subserver.  It works in conjunction with [uSkyBlock](http://www.curse.com/bukkit-plugins/minecraft/ultimate-skyblock "now unavailable, unfortunately").

About the old version
---------------------

The previous version of SBE is currently used on skyblock, but no longer has a practical function.  It previously ensured animals could not be attacked, but required/assumed [WorldGaurd](http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/WorldGuard) protection to do so.  Unfortunately, at some point in time uSkyBlock's protection mode was switched to default, resulting in the old version serving absolutely no practical purpose.
