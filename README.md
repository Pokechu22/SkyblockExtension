SkyblockExtension
=================

SkyblockExtension (SBE) is a modernized version of my very old skyblock plugin, created for the [Dwarfscraft Minecraft server](http://dwarfscraft.com)'s Skyblock subserver.  It works in conjunction with [uSkyBlock](http://www.curse.com/bukkit-plugins/minecraft/ultimate-skyblock "now unavailable, unfortunately").

Features
--------

The following features are included (~~struck through~~ lines are not yet finished)

 * ~~(NYF) the ability to configure exactly what different ranks of players are allowed to do on your island~~
 * ~~(NYF) the ability to temporarily invite other players to your island (guests) without them losing their island~~
 * `/multichallenge` command, which performs the same challenge multiple times at once (to negate the requirement of spamming `/c`)
 * Command that returns foreign visitors to on your island to theirs (`/island sendhome`)
 * Configuration of how many points a block is island-level wise
 * A command that retracts a previously sent TPA (for use when you tpa the wrong person) 
 * Actual help for `/island` provides some level of information!  (`/island help2`)
 * Functionality to give players a warning that Withers are 4 blocks high and not 3

About the old version
---------------------

The previous version of SBE is currently used on skyblock, but no longer has a practical function.  It previously ensured animals could not be attacked, but required/assumed [WorldGaurd](http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/WorldGuard) protection to do so.  Unfortunately, at some point in time uSkyBlock's protection mode was switched to default, resulting in the old version serving absolutely no practical purpose.
