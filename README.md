SkyblockExtension
=================

Modernized version of my older Skyblock extension plugin for the [Dwarfscraft Minecraft server](http://www.dwarfscraft.com).

This is intended to replace an older version which is currently on the server, but no longer functions.  (It depended on worldgaurd protection).

Current features:

/multichallenge command - Do a single challenge multiple times at once.  
/tpacancel command - Cancel current TPAs.  

WIP features:

Configureable protection options for each island.
